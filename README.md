# House_Price_Prediction
Object-The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features using regression models.
Peoples nowdays looking to buy a new home tend to be more conservative with their budgets and market strategies. The functioning of this project involves some good amount of dataset which is taken from kaggle and on which prediction is going to done. This model will help the new people predicting the price of houses in future,based on various features like bhk, bathroom, parking etc.
# Project Structure
There is basically 4 steps that has to be done:
1-Exploratory data Analysis: It is done to extract some meaningful insights from the dataset which includes, finding data description,  handling missing values, removing outliers, Dependency of numerical features or categorical features on the dependent variable by using some visualization techniques.

2-Feature Scaling: To scale the data values to a specific value range. Here, MinMax Scaler is used which shrinks the data within the range 0 and 1.

3-Feature Selection: Lasso regression is used for regularization and feature section.

4-Model Implementation: Model implementation basically includes, dividing the data into train and test data with 80:20 ratio. And then training several models (linear regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor) and analyzing their performance.
